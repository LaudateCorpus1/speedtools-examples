GATLING LOAD TEST TOOL
----------------------

Gatling is a load testing tool for web services. You can find it at:

http://gatling.io/

Gatling itself was written in Scala and the JARs to execute Gatling
have been included in this repository.

Gatling scenarios are written in Scala, using Gatling libraries.
You can find them in <GATLING-HOME>/user-files/scenarios

To execute Gatling, type:
<GATLING-HOME/bin/gatling.sh

If you wish to edit the scenarios in IntelliJ IDEA, you might wish
to add the Gatling JARs from <GATLING-HOME>/lib to the project (in
IDEA), so the editor is able to show syntax highlighting.

For more info, please refer to the Gatling website (gatling.io).
